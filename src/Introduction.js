                I am a young smart and open minded individual
passionate about solving problems. I love
environments and scenarios that allow me to think
and solve problems. I’m also passionate about
teaching which I am excellent at and I find pleasure
in helping others understand. I don’t see myself as
the best engineer but I am always willing and ready
to learn.
